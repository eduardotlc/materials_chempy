## Informations
---

- The codes in this repository are still in the eraly stages of developement, not being yet suited for general use.

- Initial focus in certain imaging and spectroscopy techniques.

- Developement mostly in python, matplotlib, and Qt backends, suited for using in jupyter notebooks for example

- Example notebooks of in progress work will be updated to the repository /notebooks folder

- Visualization and other analysis techniques are considered with a
  focus in nanoparticles and MOFs compounds class.
